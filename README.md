# Gatitor

## Motivation
It will be a learning process :)

This project is an attempt to make an terminal editor that will implement things that I learned from my neverending search for  "the one editor". Trying out new ideas for ergonomic editing.


The real inspiration for this project comes with of my experience with gaming in MMOS learning my habits and how to setup shortcuts for my type of hands. 
My goal is to make it easy for a user to get started without to edit code and configurations.

The starting point will (of course) be [kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)


## Design wishes
- ease of use: default keybindings will be on alphanumeric only as it's a chore for some keyboard layouts to map those properly (changable of course) 
- strong left hand navigation: Eg. CTRL-WASD movement,
- easy to understand: the keybindings will be layed out to be the inverse of the other. Example: CTRL-F will be search forwoard and CTRL-SHIFT-F search backwards 
- minimal dependencies for portability
